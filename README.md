# GPT Model Training on Tiny Shakespeare Dataset with Transformer Architecture

This notebook demonstrates the process of training a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model on the tiny Shakespeare dataset, utilizing the transformer architecture. Transformers are a class of deep learning models that have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by enabling models to process sequences of data in parallel, significantly improving efficiency and effectiveness over previous models like RNNs and LSTMs.

## Dataset

The tiny Shakespeare dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of Shakespeare's works. The notebook showcases preprocessing techniques suitable for transformer-based models, including character-to-integer encoding and dataset segmentation into training and validation sets.

## Transformers Overview

Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms to weigh the significance of different words in a sentence, allowing the model to learn context and relationships between words in a sequence. There are primarily two types of transformers:

- **Encoder-only Transformers:** These are designed for tasks like sentence classification, where the entire input sequence is important for generating a single output. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a prominent example of an encoder-only transformer.
- **Decoder-only Transformers:** Tailored for generative tasks where the model predicts the next token in a sequence based on the previous tokens. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models fall into this category and are exemplified in this notebook.

## Features

- **Dataset Preprocessing:** Techniques for encoding the dataset for transformer models.
- **Training and Validation Split:** Methods to split the dataset for effective model training.
- **Transformer Model Training:** Training a GPT model, a decoder-only transformer, using PyTorch. This includes configuring a model optimizer.
- **Text Generation:** Leveraging the trained GPT model to generate text, showcasing the model's understanding of language and context.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Necessary libraries to support PyTorch operations and data processing.

## How to Run

1. Install all required dependencies.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in a compatible IPython notebook environment.
3. Sequentially execute the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate text using the trained model.

## Transformer in This Notebook

The focus of this notebook is on a decoder-only transformer, specifically a GPT model. It includes detailed explanations of the transformer architecture, emphasizing the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to effectively generate text by considering the entire context of the input sequence. The notebook provides practical examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts and techniques involved in training and leveraging a GPT model for text generation.
